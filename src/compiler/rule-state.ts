/**
 * Rule-extraction change-detection state (rule pipeline).
 *
 * `llmwiki rules extract` must decide which sources to (re)process on its own
 * cadence, independent of the concept compiler. If it reused `.llmwiki/state.json`
 * a source already compiled into pages would be considered "unchanged" and
 * yield zero rule candidates, while a source not yet compiled would be
 * re-extracted on every run. This module persists a parallel per-source hash
 * map in `.llmwiki/rule-state.json` so rule extraction advances its own cursor.
 *
 * The shape mirrors {@link WikiState} (so `detectChanges` can compare against
 * it directly), but only the per-source `hash` is meaningful here — `concepts`
 * is always empty because rule extraction produces candidates, not pages.
